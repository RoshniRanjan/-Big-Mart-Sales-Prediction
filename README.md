Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model to forecast sales for Big Mart. The model will be based 
on historical sales data from various stores and products.
Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
Data Analysis: Explore and analyze the provided Big Mart sales dataset to understand the 
characteristics and patterns of the data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for machine learning modeling by handling missing 
values, outliers, and categorical data.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the data to enhance the predictive power of the 
model.
Model Selection and Evaluation: Train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms, such as 
linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost, to predict sales accurately.
Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model into a production environment for real-world 
sales predictions
